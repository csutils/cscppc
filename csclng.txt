NAME
----
csclng - a compiler wrapper that runs the Clang analyzer in background


SYNOPSIS
--------
*csclng* ['--help' | '--print-path-to-wrap']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
csclng is a compiler wrapper that runs clang in background.  Create a
symbolic link to csclng named as your compiler (gcc, g++, ...) and put it
to your $PATH.

The following parameters are given to clang by default:

    * --analyze

The following parameters are passed to clang from compiler's command line:

    * -D...

    * -I...

    * -include ...

    * -iquote ...

    * -isystem ...

The following file extensions are recognized as C/C++ source files:

    * c

    * C

    * cc

    * cpp

    * cxx

The following path substrings are black-listed from being scanned by clang:

    * conftest.c

    * _configtest.c

    * /CMakeTmp/

    * ../test.c

If csclng is installed on system, the following command activates the wrapper:
-------------------------------------------------
export PATH="`csclng --print-path-to-wrap`:$PATH"
-------------------------------------------------


OPTIONS
-------
*--help*::
    Prints basic usage information.

*--print-path-to-wrap*::
    Prints path to the directory with symlinks to the csclng executable.


EXIT STATUS
-----------
csclng propagates the exit status returned by the compiler (in case csclng
succeeds to run the compiler).  The exit status returned by clang does not
affect the resulting exit status.


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------
*DEBUG_CSCLNG*::
    If set to a non-empty string, csclng outputs the list of parameters given
    to clang to the standard output.

*CSCLNG_ADD_OPTS*::
    csclng expects a colon-separated list of Clang options that should be
    appended to command line prior to invoking Clang.  The options are
    appended even if they already appear in the command line and they are
    always appended at the end of the command line.
